Welcome to the Cadasta Project Ideas wiki. Cadasta is participating for the second time in the Outreachy Session running from **May 2016 until August 2016**. 

## Information on Outreachy (from the [Outreachy Website](https://www.gnome.org/outreachy/))
"Outreachy helps people from groups underrepresented in free and open source software get involved. We provide a supportive community for beginning to contribute any time throughout the year and offer focused internship opportunities twice a year with a number of free software organizations.
The current round of internships is open internationally to women (cis and trans), trans men, and genderqueer people. Additionally, it's open to residents and nationals of the United States of any gender who are Black/African American, Hispanic/Latin@, American Indian, Alaska Native, Native Hawaiian, or Pacific Islander. We are planning to expand the program to more participants from underrepresented backgrounds in the future."
